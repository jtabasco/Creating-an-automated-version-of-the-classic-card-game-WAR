# Automated WAR Card Game

This project implements an automated version of the classic card game "WAR" using Python. It simulates the traditional "War Card Game" mechanics between two players, determining a winner after a set number of rounds.

## Features

* **WAR Game Simulation:** Full implementation of the game's rules.
* **Card Deck:** Generation and manipulation of a standard 52-card deck.
* **Players:** Simulation of two players, each with their own hand of cards.
* **Round Logic:** Implementation of the logic to determine the winner of each round and handle "war" situations.
* **Winner Determination:** Calculation of the final winner based on the players' remaining cards.
* **Game Statistics:** Displays the number of rounds played, ties, and the winner.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/jtabasco/Creating-an-automated-version-of-the-classic-card-game-WAR.git](https://github.com/jtabasco/Creating-an-automated-version-of-the-classic-card-game-WAR.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

    ```bash
    cd Creating-an-automated-version-of-the-classic-card-game-WAR
    ```

3.  **Run the Game:**

    ```bash
    python war.py
    ```

## Project Structure

* `war.py`: Main file containing the game logic.
* `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Suggested Improvements

* **User Interface:** Implement a graphical or text-based user interface for a more interactive user experience.
* **Advanced Statistics:** Record and display detailed game statistics, such as the number of wars, average game duration, etc.
* **Code Modularization:** Divide the code into smaller, reusable modules to improve organization and maintainability.
* **Unit Testing:** Add unit tests to ensure the game's correct functionality.
* **Documentation:** Add comments to the code to improve readability.
