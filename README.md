This project implements an automated version of the classic card game "WAR" using Java. It simulates the traditional "War Card Game" mechanics between two players, determining a winner after a set number of rounds.

## ✨ Features

* **🎴 WAR Game Simulation:** Full implementation of the game's rules.
* **🃏 Card Deck:** Generation and manipulation of a standard 52-card deck.
* **👥 Players:** Simulation of two players, each with their own hand of cards.
* **⚔️ Round Logic:** Implementation of the logic to determine the winner of each round and handle "war" situations.
* **🏆 Winner Determination:** Calculation of the final winner based on the players' remaining cards.
* **📊 Game Statistics:** Displays the number of rounds played, ties, and the winner.

## 📋 Requirements

* Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (version 8 or higher).
* An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA (optional).

## 🚀 Installation

1.  **📥 Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jtabasco/Creating-an-automated-version-of-the-classic-card-game-WAR.git
    ```

2.  **🔨 Compile the Project:**

    * If using an IDE, import the project as a Java project and compile it.
    * If preferring the command line, navigate to the project directory and compile the `.java` files using `javac`.

3.  **▶️ Run the Game:**

    * From the IDE, run the main class (`war.java` or the class containing the `main` method).
    * From the command line, run the generated .class file using the command "java war".

## 📁 Project Structure

* `war.java`: Main file containing the game logic.
* `README.md`: Project documentation.

## 💡 Suggested Improvements

* **🖥️ User Interface:** Implement a graphical or text-based user interface for a more interactive user experience.
* **📈 Advanced Statistics:** Record and display detailed game statistics, such as the number of wars, average game duration, etc.
* **🧩 Code Modularization:** Divide the code into smaller, reusable classes and packages to improve organization and maintainability.
* **🔍 Unit Testing:** Add unit tests using JUnit to ensure the game's correct functionality.
* **📝 Documentation:** Add comments to the code to improve readability, and/or generate Javadoc documentation.
