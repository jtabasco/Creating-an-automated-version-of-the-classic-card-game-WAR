# Automated WAR Card Game (Java)

This project implements an automated version of the classic card game "WAR" using Java. It simulates the traditional "War Card Game" mechanics between two players, determining a winner after a set number of rounds.

## Features

* **WAR Game Simulation:** Full implementation of the game's rules.
* **Card Deck:** Generation and manipulation of a standard 52-card deck.
* **Players:** Simulation of two players, each with their own hand of cards.
* **Round Logic:** Implementation of the logic to determine the winner of each round and handle "war" situations.
* **Winner Determination:** Calculation of the final winner based on the players' remaining cards.
* **Game Statistics:** Displays the number of rounds played, ties, and the winner.

## Requirements

* Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (version 8 or higher).
* An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA (optional).

## Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/jtabasco/Creating-an-automated-version-of-the-classic-card-game-WAR.git](https://github.com/jtabasco/Creating-an-automated-version-of-the-classic-card-game-WAR.git)
    ```

2.  **Compile the Project:**

    * If using an IDE, import the project as a Java project and compile it.
    * If preferring the command line, navigate to the project directory and compile the `.java` files using `javac`.

3.  **Run the Game:**

    * From the IDE, run the main class (`war.java` or the class containing the `main` method).
    * From the command line, run the generated .class file using the command "java war".

## Project Structure

* `war.java`: Main file containing the game logic.
* `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Suggested Improvements

* **User Interface:** Implement a graphical or text-based user interface for a more interactive user experience.
* **Advanced Statistics:** Record and display detailed game statistics, such as the number of wars, average game duration, etc.
* **Code Modularization:** Divide the code into smaller, reusable classes and packages to improve organization and maintainability.
* **Unit Testing:** Add unit tests using JUnit to ensure the game's correct functionality.
* **Documentation:** Add comments to the code to improve readability, and/or generate Javadoc documentation.
